# DNN OpenContent VUE builder Demo Templates

[Open Content](https://opencontent.readme.io/) 5 contains a new Form editor based on VUE.js
See: https://opencontent.readme.io/docs/migrating-existing-templates-to-builder-v2


This repositiory will contain templates that work with the new builder as not all v4 fields still work (or are replaced by others).
